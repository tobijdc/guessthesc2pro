You have to guess the SC2 player in a certain amount of tries.
With every try you will see how the guessed player compares to the player we are looking for.

I hope you enjoy.

If you like the game, hit be up on Bluesky <i class="fa-brands fa-bluesky"></i>. I'm [@tobijdc](https://bsky.app/profile/tobijdc.bsky.social).
